# Chtr 4: Ownership in Rust

- This is Rust's most unique feature ,and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.

## What is Ownership

- All programs have to manage the way they use computer memory while running. Some languages have [_garbage collectiors_](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-guide-to-garbage-collection-in-programming/) that constantly look for memory that is no longer in use as the program runs whereas in other languages the programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach where memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. None of the ownership features slow down your program while it’s running.

- Ownership in Rust is a unique concept that ensures the safe and efficient management of memory in programs. It revolves around the idea that each value has a single owner, preventing common issues like dangling pointers and memory leaks. Rust's ownership system also allows for temporary borrowing of values, ensuring controlled access without ownership transfer. By enforcing these rules at compile-time, this is what guarantees memory safety and elimination of data races, making Rust a reliable language for building secure and performant applications.
- Before we dive into ownership, it's important to understand how memory is managed by a computer using stacks and heaps..

### Stacks & Heaps

- Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory that are available to your code to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order.This is referred to as _last in, first out_.

:::note

Think of a stack of plates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called _pushing_ onto the stack, and removing data is called _popping_ off the stack.
:::

- All data stored on the stack must have a known and fixed size. So data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the _heap_ instead.

- The heap is less organized its like a big storage area where we can put data that we need. When we want to store something on the heap, we ask the computer for a specific amount of space. The computer finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as "in use," and gives us a special address called a pointer (_This pointer tells us where our data is stored in the heap_). This process is called _allocating on the heap_ and is sometimes abbreviated as just _allocating_.

- To access our data, we follow the pointer. The stack, on the other hand, is a more organized place where we store smaller things quickly. We don't need to worry about finding space or following pointers on the stack.(_Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating_)

:::note

Think of a heap as being seated at a restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and the staff finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to find you.
:::

- Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the operating system never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires more work, because the operating system must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.
- Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table.
  - Taking an order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap). Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time.
- When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack.
- Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the stack and the heap very often, but knowing that managing heap data is why ownership exists can help explain why it works the way it does.

- So if your writing a high level app(website) it makes sense to sacrifice runtime performance for a lesser size for ease of use and faster write time you get with the _garbage collector_ and manual memory management for high-level components.

### Ownership Rules

1. Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its _owner_.
2. There can be only one owner at a time.
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### Variable scope

- A _scope_ is the range within a program for which an item is valid.
- A variable is valid from the point its declared to the end of that scope.

  ```rust
  {
     // s is not valid here; it's not yet declared
    let s = "hello"; // s is valid from this point forward
    // do stuff with s
  } // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid

  ```

### The String Type

- To illustrate ownership, we need a datatype that is more complex.The types covered previously are all stored on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, but we want to look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to clean up that data.
- We’ll use String as the example here and concentrate on the parts of String that relate to ownership. These aspects also apply to other complex data types provided by the standard library and that you create.
- String literals are convenient but not suitable for every situation. One reason is that they’re immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write our code: e.g., taking user input and storing it? For these situations, Rust has a second string type, String. This type is allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time.
  `let s = String::from("Hello")`
- The double colon `::` is an operator that allows us to access the functions or types within a particular namespace like the String type rather than using some name like `string_from`. _More about this in “Method Syntax”_

- This kind of string can be mutated:

  ```rust
  let mut s = String::from("hello");
  s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String
  println!("{}", s); // this will print `hello, world!`
  ```

> So, what’s the difference here, Why can String be mutated but literals cannot?
> The difference is how these two types deal with memory.

### Memory and Allocation

- In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. _This is why string literals are fast and efficient_. But these properties only come from the string literal’s immutability. Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory into the binary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose size might change while running the program.
- With the String type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means

  - The memory must be requested from the operating system at runtime.
  - We need a way of returning this memory to the operating system when we’re done with our `String`.

- First part is done by us when we call `String::from` (_Common for all languages_).However, the second part is different. In languages with a garbage collector (GC), the GC keeps track and cleans up memory that isn’t being used anymore, and we don’t need to think about it. Problem with this is we need to pair exactly one allocate with exactly one free otherwise we get bugs.
- Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope and rust calls its `drop` function.

### Variables and Data Interacting with move

- Multiple variables interact with the same data in different ways.

  ```rust
  let x= 5;
  let y= x;
  ```

- We can probably guess what this is doing: “bind the value 5 to x; then make a copy of the value in x and binds it to y.”
- We now have two variables, x and y, and both equal 5. This is indeed what is happening, because integers are simple values with a known and fixed size and these two 5 values are pushed onto the stack.
- Lets Consider the `String` Version;

  ```rust
  let s1 = String::from("hello");
  let s2 = s1;
  ```

  - A String is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the heap that holds the contents.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/string_heap_rep.jpg" alt="string_bind drawing" />
  <caption>
    Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a String holding the value "hello"
    bound to s1
  </caption>
</figure>

- **_Length_** - Memory in bytes that the contents of the String are currently using.
- **_Capacity_** - Memory in bytes that String has received from Operating System.
- When we assign s1 to s2, the String data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data representation in memory looks like _Figure 4-2_
  <center>
    <img src="/images/string_bind.jpg" alt="string_bind drawing" />
  </center>
- The representation does not look like _Figure 4-3_, which is what memory would look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the operation `s2 = s1` could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if the data on the heap were large.
- Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically calls the drop function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable.But `Figure 4-2` shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a problem: when s2 and s1 go out of scope, they will both try to free the same memory. This is known as a _double free error_ and is one of the memory safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

- To ensure memory safety, Rust considers s1 to no longer be valid and, therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when s1 goes out of scope. Check out what happens when you try
  to use s1 after s2 is created; it won’t work.

```rust
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;
//  this would reslut in an error
    println!("{}, world!", s1);
```

- You will get an error like this

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)

```

- If you’ve heard the terms shallow copy and deep copy while working with other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a shallow copy, it’s known as a _move_. In this example, we would say that `s1` was moved into `s2`

- That solves our problem! With only s2 valid, when it goes out of scope it alone will free the memory, and we’re done.

- In addition, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will never automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any automatic copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance

### Variables and Data Interactions with Clone

- If we do want to [_deeply copy_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-shallow-and-deep-copy-of-a-class/) the heap data of the String, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called `clone`.Here Heap data is copied

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

- This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3, where the heap data does get copied

### Stack-Only Data: Copy

- There’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. The code (_in the move example_) using integers works and is valid.
- But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to `clone`, but x is still valid and wasn’t moved into y.The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent x from being valid after we create the variable y. In other words, there’s no difference between deep and shallow copying here, so calling clone wouldn’t do anything different from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out.Rust has a special annotation called `Copy` trait
- Here are some of the types that are `Copy`:
  • All the integer types, such as `u32`.
  • The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
  • The character type, `char`.
  • All the floating point types, such as `f64`.
  • Tuples, if they only contain types that are also Copy. For example, `(i32,
i32)` is Copy, but `(i32, String)` is not.

### Ownership & Functions.

- The semantics for passing a value to a function are similar to those for assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does

```rust
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("hello"); // s comes into scope
  takes_ownership(s); // s's value moves into the function...
  // ... and so is no longer valid here
  let x = 5; // x comes into scope
  makes_copy(x); // x would move into the function,
  // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to
  // still use x afterward
     println!("x: {}", x);
} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved,
// nothing special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
  println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
// memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

- If we tried to use s after the call to takes_ownership, Rust would throw a compile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding code to main that uses s and x to see where you can use them and where the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.

### Return Values & Scope

- Return values can also transfer ownership.

```rs
fn main() {
  let s1 = gives_ownership(); // gives_ownership moves its return

  // value into s1
  let s2 = String::from("hello"); // s2 comes into scope
  let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2); // s2 is moved into
  // takes_and_gives_back, which also
  // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 goes out of scope but was
// moved, so nothing happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String { // gives_ownership will move its return value into the function that calls it

  let some_string = String::from("hello"); // some_string comes into scope
  some_string // some_string is returned and
  // moves out to the calling
  // function
}

// takes_and_gives_back will take a String and return one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
  // scope
  a_string // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

- The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by drop unless the data has been moved to be owned by another variable. Taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership? It’s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.
- It’s possible to return multiple values using a tuple.

```rs
fn main() {
  let s1 = String::from("hello");
  let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);
  println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}
fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
  let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String
  (s, length)
}
```

- But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for this concept, called [_references_](#references-and-borrowing)

## References and Borrowing

- The issue with the tuple code is that we have to return the `String` to the calling function so we can still use the `String` after the call to `calculate_length`, because the String was moved into `calculate_length`.
- Here is how you would define and use a `calculate_length` function that has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value.

```rs
fn main() {
  let s1 = String::from("hello");
  let len = calculate_length(&s1);
  println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
  s.len()
}
```

- These ampersands are references.

  <center>
    <img src="/images/ref.jpg" alt="drawing" />
  </center>

- The `&s1` syntax lets us create a reference that refers to the value of s1 but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference goes out of scope.Likewise, the signature of the function uses `&` to indicate that the type of the parameter s is a reference. Let’s add some explanatory annotations

```rs
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of
// what it refers to, nothing happens
```

- The scope in which the variable s is valid is the same as any function parameter’s scope, but we don’t drop what the reference points to when it goes out of scope because we don’t have ownership. When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we don’t need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.
- We call having references as function parameters borrowing. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have to give it back
- So if we try to modify what we borrowed we get an error.

```rs
fn main() {
let s = String::from("hello");
change(&s);
}
fn change(some_string: &String) {
some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

### Mutable References

```rs
fn main() {
let mut s = String::from("hello");
change(&mut s);
}
fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

- But mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = 42;

    let reference1 = &mut data; // Mutable reference 1

    // Uncommenting the following line will result in a compilation error
    // let reference2 = &mut data; // Mutable reference 2

    *reference1 += 1; // Modifying the data through mutable reference 1

    println!("Data: {}", data); // Output: Data: 43
}
```

- Here's the resulting error.

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> src/main.rs:5:14
  |
4 |     let r1 = &mut s;
  |              ------ first mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &mut s;
  |              ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
6 |
7 |     println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
  |                        -- first borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0499`.
error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error

```

- The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time. A data race is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:
  - Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
  - At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
  - There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data
- As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not simultaneous ones:

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
```

- A similar rule exists for combining mutable and immutable references

```rs
let mut s = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
```

### Dangling References

- A pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else, by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory.
- the compiler guarantees that references will
  never be dangling references.
- Dangling references occur when a reference points to memory that has been deallocated or no longer exists. In Rust, the compiler enforces strict rules to prevent dangling references, ensuring memory safety.

- For example, consider the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangling_reference();
}

fn dangling_reference() -> &String {
    let data = String::from("Hello");
    &data
}

```

- Dangling references occur when a reference points to memory that has been deallocated or no longer exists. In Rust, the compiler enforces strict rules to prevent dangling references, ensuring memory safety.

- For example, consider the following code:

```rust

fn main() {
  let reference_to_nothing = dangling_reference();
}

fn dangling_reference() -> &String {
  let data = String::from("Hello");
  &data
}
```

- In this code, the function `dangling_reference` creates a `String` named `data` and returns a reference to it. However, once the function finishes executing, data goes out of scope, and its memory is deallocated. The reference `reference_to_nothing` is left pointing to invalid memory, resulting in a dangling reference.
- Rust's borrowing rules prevent such situations by ensuring that references are always valid and pointing to live data. In this case, the compiler would raise an error, highlighting the attempt to create a dangling reference and preventing it from happening.
- By enforcing strict ownership and borrowing rules, Rust helps eliminate dangling references, ensuring memory safety and preventing bugs caused by referencing invalid or deallocated memory.

### The Rules of References

- Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:
  - At any given time, you can have either but not both of the following: one
    mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
  - References must always be valid.
- Next, we’ll look at a different kind of reference: slices

## The Slice Type

- Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

- Here’s a small programming problem: write a function that takes a string of words separated by spaces and returns the first word it finds in that string. If the function doesn’t find a space in the string, the whole string must be one word, so the entire string should be returned
- Let’s work through how we’d write the signature of this function without using slices, to understand the problem that slices will solve

`fn first_word(s: &String) -> ?`

- The `first_word` function has a `&String` as a parameter. We don’t want ownership, so this is fine. But what should we return? We don’t really have a way to talk about part of a string. However, we could return the index of the end of the word, indicated by a space.

```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
}

```

- Because we need to go through the `String` element by element and check whether a value is a space, we’ll convert our `String` to an array of bytes using the `as_bytes` method.

`   let bytes = s.as_bytes();`

- Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the iter method:
  `for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {`
- We’ll discuss iterators in more detail in Chapter 13. For now, know that iter is a method that returns each element in a collection and that enumerate wraps the result of iter and returns each element as part of a tuple instead. The first element of the tuple returned from enumerate is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element. This is a bit more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.
- Because the enumerate method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to destructure that tuple. We’ll be discussing patterns more in Chapter 6. In the for loop, we specify a pattern that has i for the index in the tuple and `&item` for the single byte in the tuple. Because we get a reference to the element from `.iter().enumerate()`, we use `&` in the pattern.
- Inside the for loop, we search for the byte that represents the space by using the byte literal syntax. If we find a space, we return the position. Otherwise, we return the length of the string by using `s.len()`

```rust
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
```

- We now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in the string, but there’s a problem. We’re returning a usize on its own, but it’s only a meaningful number in the context of the `&String`. In other words, because it’s a separate value from the `String`, there’s no guarantee that it will still be valid in the future. Consider the program that uses the first_word function.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5

    s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to ""

    // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
    // we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is now totally invalid!
}
```

- This program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used word after calling `s.clear()`. Because word isn’t connected to the state of s at all, word still contains the value 5. We could use that value `5` with the variable s to try to extract the first word out, but this would be a bug because the contents of s have changed since we saved 5 in word.

- Having to worry about the index in word getting out of sync with the data in s is tedious and error prone! Managing these indices is even more brittle if we write a second_word function. Its signature would have to look like this:

`fn second_word(s: &String) -> (usize, usize) {`

- Now we’re tracking a starting and an ending index, and we have even more values that were calculated from data in a particular state but aren’t tied to that state at all. We have three unrelated variables floating around that need to be kept in sync.

- Luckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.

### String Slices

```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");
let hello = &s[0..5];
u let world = &s[6..11];
```


- `syntax`

`[starting _index..ending_index]`
